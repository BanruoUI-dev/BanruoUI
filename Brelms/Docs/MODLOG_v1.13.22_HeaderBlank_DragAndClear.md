Bre v1.13.22

- Fix: Header blank area click-capture no longer breaks window dragging.
- Change: Header blank area now supports both:
  - Dragging the main window (LeftButton drag)
  - Clear selection on click (LeftButton click), without implicit commit

Notes
- Clear selection is suppressed while an EditBox has keyboard focus.
